The problem is MENTAL HEALTH IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS 
DEPRESSION 
I am putting my main emphasis on depression part as the sub-problem of 
Mental health in University students.
Depression is a serious mental health condition that can cause persistent 
Sadness and hopelessness in a person's life.
My sub-problems
Sadness. This emotional state is characterized by sorrow, 
Loss, despair, and grief.
Anxious. This is the state of feeling worried, nervous, or apprehensive.
Losing interest in doing daily activities. When someone loses interest in 
daily activities, they may find that they no longer enjoy things they 
used to find pleasurable.
My sub-solutions
Sadness. if the victim is sad I will recommend him to seek trained listeners 
who can provide support and advice on symptoms of depr ession while in 
school.
Anxious. The software will connect the victim with other people who are also 
struggling with anxiety. This can provide you with a sense of community and 
support to help reduce anxiety and improve his overall mood.

1. Sub-Solution: Recommend seeking trained listeners
function recommendSeekingTrainedListeners():
    if victim is sad:
        display "Seek support and advice from trained listeners."

2. Sub-Solution. Connect with others struggling with anxiety
function connectWithAnxietyCommunity():
    if the victim is anxious:
        display "Connect with a community of people struggling with anxiety."
The "recommendSeekingTrainedListeners()" function checks if the victim is sad and, if so, recommends seeking support and advice from trained listeners. This function can be implemented to provide information about available resources, such as counseling services or mental health professionals, who can offer support to students experiencing sadness.

The "connectWithAnxietyCommunity()" function checks if the victim is anxious and, if so, recommends connecting with a community of people who are also struggling with anxiety. This can be implemented by providing information about support groups, online forums, or campus organizations where students can find a sense of community and receive support from others who understand their experiences.
Defining of variables.
1. Sub-Solution: Recommend seeking trained listeners
function recommendSeekingTrainedListeners(victim):
    if the victim is sad.
        display "Seek support and advice from trained listeners."
In this function, the "victim" variable represents the person who is experiencing the mental health issue. It can be a specific identifier, such as a student's name or an object that contains relevant information about the individual.

2. Sub-Solution: Connect with others struggling with anxiety
function connectWithAnxietyCommunity(victim):
    if the victim is anxious:
        display "Connect with a community of people struggling with anxiety."
In this function, the "victim" variable represents the person who is experiencing the mental health issue. Similar to the previous function, it can be a specific identifier or an object containing relevant information about the individual.
